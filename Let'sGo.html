        <h1>The Banff Springs Hotel, <br><span>Canada</span></h1>
        <p>With overtures of the Timberline Lodge of Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining fame, the Banff Springs Hotel of Canada is said to be the home of a plethora of ghost stories and mysterious happenings.

          Locals tell tales of an entire family that was murdered in cold-blood in room 873. Others talk of reappearing doormen who vanish into thin air.
          
          But if you think you can deal with the supernatural rep, then you’re in for a real treat here.
          
          The handsome hotel oozes Scottish Baronial styles, is shrouded by the fir-dressed peaks of the Canadian Rockies, and offers access to the iconic ski fields of Jasper and Banff.</p>

        <h1>Bhangarh Fort,<br><span>India</span></h1>
        <p>Enfolded by the rises of the Aravali Hills and baked by the Rajasthani sun, the old bulwarks of the Bhangarh Fort are said to echo with the ethereal presence of one cursed princess and her would-be captor, the wizard Sinhai.

          It’s said that Sinhai tried to ensnare the young royal by offering her a love potion.
          
          The plan backfired, the wizard ended up dead, but not before he could lay his hex on all the inhabitants of Bhangarh.
          
          Today, the Mughlai complex once trodden by Madho Singh I is considered one of the most haunted spots in India.
          
          No one is allowed to enter after dark, and locals have even reported deaths as a result of the continued curse!</p>

        <h1>The Tower of London,<br><span>England</span></h1>
        <p>The beheading of kings, the incarceration of state enemies, the plotting of political machinations from the Tudors to the Elizabethans; all manner of dark and shady deeds has gone down between the crenulations of London’s old fortress on the north bank.

          Stories of hauntings and mysterious happenings began with the sighting of Thomas Becket (a martyred saint), who is said to have stymied construction of the palace’s extension from the grave.
          
          However, it’s the apparition of one Queen Anne Boleyn that causes the biggest stir – her headless body is seen lurking by the spot where she was killed at the behest of Henry VII back in the 1530s!</p>

        <h1>Transylvania<br><span>Romania</span></h1>
        <p>Sylvan hills and mist-topped mountains, the clanging echo of church bells and the stone-built medieval steeples of towns like Sibiu, Brasov and Cluj, all add to the eerie atmosphere of this vast region at the very heart of Romania.

          But it’s one place that really brings the chills and gets the spine a-tingling: Bran Castle.
          
          This turret-topped citadel soars from the forests on the edge of Wallachia in a medley of Gothic towers and gargoyle-peppered roofs.
          
          Over the years it’s been associated with a number of less-than-savoury, uber-mysterious figures: Vlad the Impaler, the most bloodthirsty of the Wallachian kings, and – of course – Count Dracula, the archetype of the nail-biting Nosferatu.</p>

        <h1>Crooked Forest,.<br><span>Poland</span></h1>
        <p>Just south of the unpronounceable city of Szczecin on Poland’s extreme eastern haunch, a stone’s throw west of the border with Germany, a small clutch of just over 400 pine trees has been garnering the attention of Atlas Obscura types and off-the-beaten-track travelers for years.

          The entire forest appears to be bent over almost 90 degrees at the trunk, before twisting back straight again and growing vertically into the Slavic sky.
          
          Debate has raged as to what caused the unusual wood to come to look like it has, with theories as wide ranging as torrential snowstorms and lumberjack growing techniques.
          
          Weird.</p>
